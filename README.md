# Web Scraping and Data Analysis - Mars Project

# Introduction:
This project involves scraping data from various sources related to Mars, utilizing both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You will scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles and analyze Mars weather data from a table.

# What You're Creating:
This assignment consists of two deliverables:

# Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News:
Open the Jupyter Notebook named part_1_mars_news.ipynb provided in the starter code folder.
Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and identify elements to scrape.
Create a Beautiful Soup object to extract text elements from the website.
Extract titles and preview text of the news articles, storing them in Python dictionaries.
Optionally, store the scraped data in a JSON file.

# Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data:
Open the Jupyter Notebook named part_2_mars_weather.ipynb provided in the starter code folder.
Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and identify elements to scrape.
Create a Beautiful Soup object to scrape data from the HTML table.
Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Analyze the dataset to answer specific questions using Pandas functions.
Determine the number of months on Mars.
Calculate the number of Martian days worth of data in the dataset.
Identify the coldest and warmest months on Mars based on average minimum daily temperature.
Determine which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars.
Estimate the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year.
Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.

# Conclusion:
Summarize key findings and insights from the data analysis, highlighting any trends or patterns observed in the Mars weather data.
